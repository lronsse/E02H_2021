List of components to create in cad:

- vertical stiffeners
- Ribs just behind the vertical stiffeners
- when stringer positioning is given, add them to the assembly + cut-outs in the rib
- addition of the sleeve (connection of the 2 wingboxes) in the assembly
- Do the second wingbox with the different layout of rib and vert. stiffeners (see picture on group chat).
- rivet holes in every part (don't forget the ribs).
